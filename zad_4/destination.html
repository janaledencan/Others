				<h3>DAY 1: COLOMBO ARRIVAL</h3>
				<p>We landed in Colombo at night and decided to sleep in Negombo (where the international airport is located). If you happen to land in the morning then use this day to explore the capital city of Sri Lanka. We honestly skipped sightseeing in Colombo because I wanted to maximize our time in the countryside.</p>

				<h3>DAY 2: DRIVE FROM COLOMBO TO SIGIRIYA ROCK & DAMBULLA CAVES</h3>
				<p>This will be one of your most hectic days on the itinerary. Our Kangaroo cab arrived promptly before 7 am since the drive from Negombo to Sigiriya was going to be 5-6 hours. If you can leave earlier than that, it’s even better.
				Once we reached Sigiriya, our driver dropped us near the ticket counter and went on to wait for us at the parking lot. TIP: Sigiriya is the Lion Rock Fortress and if you plan to hike it all the way to the top you need to set aside a good 3-4 hours.
				After hiking Sigiriya, we drove to the nearby Dambulla Buddhist caves and monastery. We reached there just in time to watch the most peaceful sunset ever seen. We exited Dambulla caves from a different route that led us to the Golden Temple which is where our cab driver was waiting. From here we drove straight to Kandy to rest for the night.</p>

				<h3>DAY 3: EXPLORE KANDY</h3>
				<p>Whether you reach Kandy on the night of day 2 or the morning of day 3 take some time to visit the highlights of this gorgeous city in a day. The Buddha tooth relic temple in Kandy is something you cannot miss. TIP: If you are not a Sri Lankan resident you will have to buy an entrance ticket to go inside the tooth relic temple.
				You must wear appropriate clothing that covers your shoulders and knees in order to enter the Buddha tooth relic temple. Surprisingly my mother, who’s been to more temples than any of us, forgot to carry a scarf to cover her shoulders. She was obviously denied entry at the main gates of the temple so we came up with a brilliant plan B.  We asked one of the flower vendors that surround the temple gates to let us borrow a piece of cloth or a scarf and in return we would buy flowers for the temple from their stall. In barely any time we were handed the flowers and the scarf which tells me this must a common tourist ask!
				Things to see in Kandy
				Buddha Tooth Relic Temple
				Kandy Lake (It’s right behind the tooth relic temple)
				Royal Botanic Gardens
				Where to stay in Kandy: We booked the Sevana City Hotel in Kandy due to its proximity to the train station. You can choose to stay closer to the Buddha Temple to be in the heart of the city.</p>

				<h3>DAY 4: KANDY TO NUWARA ELIYA TRAIN RIDE</h3>
				<p>We took an early morning train from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya so we can get a whole day to explore the hill country. Our train reservation was for a second class unreserved seating which we booked the same morning at Kandy Railway Station. These unreserved train tickets are easily available for purchase on the day of travel. But if you prefer advance booking then first class tickets are available to reserve online. TIP: The first class coach is air-conditioned and so the windows and doors do not open if you want to take “that” train shot.
				We have written the pros and cons of taking this train in another blog post.
				Transportation in Nuwara Eliya: Once you reach Nuwara Eliya train station there are tuk-tuks and cabs waiting outside the station. If you walk further uphill to the main road you might find even more options. We took a tuk-tuk from the station to our Bed & Breakfast which was located in the middle of a tea plantation.</p>

				<h3>DAY 5: NUWARA ELIYA TO ELLA TRAIN RIDE</h3>
				<p>The next day we took an early morning train from Nuwara Eliya to Ella (our second train ride in Sri Lanka). As much as I loved our train ride from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya, the ride to Ella was one of the worst experiences of our trip partly because this has become a very popular tourist route. The entire 3-4 hours of this train ride was cramped up with not even a tiny space to move around.
				Things to see in Ella
				Take the scenic train again from Nuwara Eliya to Ella or just rent a car and drive to Ella.
				Hike little Adam’s peak – That is if your legs are not killing after Sigiriya hike. My senior citizen parents would’ve disowned me if I took them on another hike so we ended up skipping this hike.
				Nine Arch bridge (Demodara bridge) – There are multiple ways to reach the bridge, hiking from Ella station is one of them or taking a tuk-tuk to the closest spot of the bridge is another. Our tuk-tuk dropped us on top of the hill above the bridge and told us that hiking down to the bridge would be our best bet. Another unexpected hike for my parents but I love them for their adventurous spirits. TIP: Take some time to explore the tea plantations near the bridge and don’t forget to check the timings of the train if you want that iconic train passing through the bridge shot!
				Ravana Waterfalls – Don’t just watch the falls from the road but walk in to see the glorious waterfall in its entirety. We saw a bunch of tourists jumping in the pool in front of the waterfall although I am not sure if swimming was really allowed here or not. TIP: Look to the other side of the waterfall from the street and you’ll see Little Adam’s Peak.
				Ravana Caves – Next to Ravana Falls is the caves if you are interested in anther hike.
				Enjoy a relaxing evening in Ella town center which is catered towards the western tourists. You’ll find plenty of cafes with great lunch and some with live music in the evening.</p>

				<h3>DAY 6: ELLA TO GALLE DRIVE</h3>
				<p>We hired a local cab service in Ella to drive us to Galle. This drive is roughly 4-5 hours if you take the highways but with local roads as detours, it can be 6 plus hours. TIP: Do not trust Google Maps or the drive time mentioned there since the Sri Lankan local highways are nothing but 2 lane byways.
				Our driver decided to ignore my Google Map recommendation and take us through a local road passing by Udawalawe National Park because he said the highways had heavy traffic due to an accident. In a way, we lucked out because this route runs parallel to the boundary lines of the National Park and we saw several elephants along our ride even though a safari wasn’t in our original itinerary.</p>

				<h3>DAY 7: EXPLORE GALLE IN THE MORNING THEN HEAD TO THE AIRPORT</h3>
				<p>Depending on your flight timings you can either take the morning to explore the Galle colonial quarters or head straight to the airport. One of the only major multi-lane highways in Sri Lanka is between Galle and Colombo with a total travel time of 2.5 hours.</p>
