				<p class="text1"><b>Architecture</b>, the art and technique of designing and building, as distinguished from
					the skills associated with construction. The practice of architecture is employed to fulfill both
					practical and expressive requirements, and thus it serves both utilitarian and aesthetic ends.
					Although these two ends may be distinguished, they cannot be separated, and the relative weight given
					to each can vary widely. Because every society—settled or nomadic—has a spatial relationship to the
					natural world and to other societies, the structures they produce reveal much about their environment
					(including climate and weather), history, ceremonies, and artistic sensibility, as well as many aspects
					of daily life.</p>

			<p class="text1"> The types of architecture are established not by architects but by society, according to the
			needs of its different institutions. Society sets the goals and assigns to the architect the job of finding
			the means of achieving them. This section of the article is concerned with architectural typology, with the
			role of society in determining the kinds of architecture, and with planning—the role of the architect in
			adapting designs to particular uses and to the general physical needs of human beings. Architecture is
			created only to fulfill the specifications of an individual or group. Economic law prevents architects
			from emulating their fellow artists in producing works for which the demand is nonexistent or only potential.
			So the types of architecture depend upon social formations and may be classified according to the role of
			the patron in the community. The types that will be discussed here—domestic, religious, governmental,
			recreational, welfare and educational, and commercial and industrial—represent the simplest classification;
			a scientific typology of architecture would require a more detailed analysis.</p>

			<p class="text1">Domestic architecture is produced for the social unit: the individual, family, or clan and their
			dependents, human and animal. It provides shelter and security for the basic physical functions of life and at
			times also for commercial, industrial, or agricultural activities that involve the family unit rather than the
			community. The basic requirements of domestic architecture are simple: a place to sleep, prepare food, eat, and
			perhaps work; a place that has some light and is protected from the weather. A single room with sturdy walls and
			roof, a door, a window, and a hearth are the necessities; all else can be considered luxury. In much of the world
			today, even where institutions have been in a continuous process of change, dwelling types of ancient or prehistoric
			origin are in use. In the industrialized United States, for instance, barns are being built according to a design
			employed in Europe in the 1st millennium BCE. The forces that produce a dynamic evolution of architectural style 
			in communal building are usually inactive in the home and farm. The lives of average people may be unaltered by
			the most fundamental changes in their institutions. The people can be successively enslaved persons, the subjects
			of a monarchy, and voting citizens without having the means or the desire to change their customs, techniques,
			or surroundings. Economic pressure is the major factor that causes average individuals to restrict their demands
			to a level far below that which the technology of their time is capable of maintaining. Frequently they build new
			structures with old techniques because experiment and innovation are more costly than repetition. But in wealthy
			cultures economy permits and customs encourage architecture to provide conveniences such as sanitation, lighting,
			and heating, as well as separate areas for distinct functions, and these may come to be regarded as necessities.
			The same causes tend to replace the conservatism of the home with the aspirations of institutional architecture
			and to emphasize the expressive as well as the utilitarian function.</p>
